# Dice

This is another spare-time hobby project, this time based around the game of street dice. 
When done, it should provide the opportunity to quickly get into a game of street dice with friends and the result determines who gets the next beer, will clean the kitchen at work next time, chooses the next pub or whatever you want to wager. 

## Goals
Again, this is an educational project for me. The aim this time is to have this fully utilize Go's templating package together with htmx and its web socket extension.
